# Responsive-Portfolio

Description:
In this homework, we are challenge with the tasks of creating this Portfolio to be able to look presentable with the screen of 980px, 768px, and 640px.

Technologies Used:
-CSS
-Github

Issues:
- I had issues on trying to fix my columns in the Portfolio.html to line up the way I want it to when the width was 640px.
-I also had issues with trying to make a toggle bar for the navigation bar. So I just kinda gabe up on trying to find a way to do that without distruting the pages.

Roadmap:
I plan to use the knowledge I learned from this homework into my future work.
